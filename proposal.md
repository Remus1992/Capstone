NAME: TIT4TAT

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:

  The initial focus group for this product is aspiring filmmakers although it could be applied to just about anything collaborative in nature. I envision it as a more professional, more streamlined, more aesthetic form of Craigslist.

  MVP: A filmmaker posts a project that he/ she would like to have made. Other filmmakers with similar projects will review your project and determine if they like it. If they do, then they will offer to work on yours in exchange that you help with theirs. In other words, a Tit For Tat exchange of services.

  HIGHER END: With time, this could be used to exchange more than just time. It might be unfeasible for someone to make a film and promise to help 10 other people make theirs. This might mean that he/ she will pay for some crew while exchanging services for another. This would be case dependent and would require further study.

Specific Functionality

  Creator’s View:
    -	Create Profile: First, the creator will create a portfolio on the webpage. This will include:
      o	First Name
      o	Last Name
      o	Email
      o	Phone Number
      o	Skills & Aptitude (Sound Mixer – Beginner, Editing – Intermediate,  Cinematography – Expert, etc.)
      o	Interests (i.e. haven’t operated sound mixer before but looking to learn)
      o	Current Employment
      o	Personal Equipment

    -	Create A Project: Second, the create the project that I am looking to gain support for. This will include:
      o	The Title of the Project
      o	A Description of the Project
        	Optional Info (PDF of script, Pictures of location, etc)
      o	A Budget (plus a definition of what that entails (for the sake of MVP, this refers strictly to food, costumes, etc.))
      o	Required Cast/ Crew Positions Needed For Project
      o	Projected Production Dates/ length (i.e. 30 minute film shot over 5 days)
      o	A Link to Their Profile (for reference) vs. Contact filmmaker

  -	Explore Projects: The filmmaker will then explore other projects listed which he/ she may examine further and decide on what to commit to. Search options might include:
    o	All Projects (from most recent to oldest)
    o	Featured Projects (maybe a pro function)
    o	Search
      	Types of Projects (Documentary vs. Narrative)
      	Projected length of project
      	Location
      	Cast/ Crew Positions
  -	Commit To A Project: Once the filmmaker has found a project and both parties have found another project they both like then they will commit publically to each other’s project. This will include a “Request” and “Accept” function.

Technical Components:
    -	I imagine I would need to ascribe an address to a given project. This will most likely require using the GoogleMaps API
    -	When listing a person’s equipment, it may be necessary to link outside references to that equipment. Who that is? I’m not sure yet.

Schedule
  From easiest to hardest (also by need of order)
    -	Creating “about page” and “basic layout for comprehension”
    -	Creating database of “users”
    -	Creating database of “projects”
    -	Search engine of both (starting with projects)
    -	Communicating between “users” (will this be on the website or require external com?)
  -	Request/Accept/ Decline project

Further Work:
  From Easiest To Hardest Tasks to Add:
    -	Expand to other fields (i.e. mini concert, software development, etc.)
    -	Expands to other means of compensation (i.e. maybe instead of working on another person’s project you may lend them your equipment thus cutting the cost of rentals from theirs)
    -	If money involved, then consider how that would be taken care of. Holding account for funds until both parties agree that terms have been met.
    -	Similarly, the legal elements of such a project.
